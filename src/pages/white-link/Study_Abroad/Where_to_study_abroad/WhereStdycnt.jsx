        Studying abroad can open doors to working in a new country and making it your home. And everything starts with the right decision.
        <br />
        Let’s explore the best countries for international students, top universities, and programs that could align with your career goals and personal interests.
      </p>

      <h2>Why choose the USA for studying abroad</h2>
      <p>
        The United States is famous for its globally recognised schools like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, which offer many programs and advanced research spaces, helping students succeed. The USA has a strong focus on new ideas and starting businesses, helping students to learn key skills that employers around the globe value highly.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the steep cost of tuition could be a reason to worry, there are multiple scholarships and funding options to help you out. Also, depending on the university you choose, you could live in either a vibrant city or a close-knit, active town. This allows you to enjoy the calm, serene countryside or the energy of the city life, whichever suits you best, while earning your qualifications. Over a million international students study at US colleges, according to March 2025 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while staying in the U.S., international students must comply with F-1 visa regulations, which significantly affect their work hours and time spent outside the country during their studies. Under these rules, F-1 visa holders are permitted to work on campus for up to 20 hours per week during the academic term and up to 40 hours per week during scheduled breaks, such as summer. Off-campus employment is generally prohibited unless students receive special authorization from their university or the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Additionally, recent visa policy changes now restrict international students from spending more than five consecutive months outside the U.S. during their academic program.

      <h2>Why choose the UK for studying abroad</h2>
      <p>
        The United Kingdom, known for its rich history and high-quality education system, is undoubtedly one of the best countries to study abroad. Its famous universities, like the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, are often considered some of the best in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying in the UK means receiving a great education while enjoying a rich culture in a friendly and welcoming setting. Students can immerse themselves in the UK’s historical and cultural heritage by visiting historic sites, attending festivals like Bonfire Night, and watching Shakespearean plays. They can also enjoy modern city life in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Glasgow, and Belfast. A key advantage is the opportunity to work while earning an internationally recognised degree. Additionally, there are many job opportunities and internships for international students within the UK. Universities throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland offer several shorter-duration programs and generous scholarships.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the degree, international students can apply for the Graduate Route visa that allows them to stay in the UK for up to two years (or three for PhDs) after graduation, giving them time to find a job.
      </p>
      <h3>Leading Institutions and Popular Programs</h3>
      <p>
        The higher education system in the United Kingdom is renowned for its academic excellence, global reputation, and rich tradition. UK universities consistently rank among the top globally, with the system emphasising critical thinking, independent learning, new ideas, and research innovation. UK universities bring in top teachers and offer many special programs. This gives students an edge in their fields.
