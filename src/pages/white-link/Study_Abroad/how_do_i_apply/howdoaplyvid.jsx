        <h2>Ways to apply to foreign universities</h2>
        <p>
          Studying abroad can be a fun and rewarding experience, and to make the most of it, understanding the application process is key.

        <p>
          There are several paths to your dream university. Let’s explore some simple ways to begin your journey.
        </p>
        <h2>Apply with an education counsellor</h2>
        <p>
          Make an education agent or counsellor your go-to buddy. They’re well-connected with universities around the world and can guide you with accurate information, help you fill out forms, and make sure you’ve got all the right documents. Their support always makes the application process smoother and less stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, education agents can share key details about getting a visa, places to stay, and other practical things about studying abroad. However, you must choose a reliable agent or counsellor with a history of doing well. IDP is one such institution with decades of experience in shaping successful international student journeys.

Most universities have dedicated sections on their websites for international students, where you’ll find detailed information about required documents, deadlines, and application steps. And if you’re unsure about anything, their admissions team is just an email away. This way, you feel more in charge of your application.
